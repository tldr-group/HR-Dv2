### ViT Features:
`DINOv2` (Dv2) [[1]](#links) is student-teacher self-distillation model for self-supervised feature learning with a `ViT` [[2]](#links) backbone. The training DS was 1.2B images - they claim it's been trained on a wide enough corpus that fine-tuning is unnecessary and show good performance by training linear heads on top of the frozen backbone. It used a more complicated training procedure than other models, like `MAEs` [[3]](#links) but promises better performance. 

Accesible `DINOv2` checkpoints are trained with a patch size of $14 \times 14$ px, meaning the features produced are at that resolution (*i.e,* $h / 14 \times w / 14$). It can be trained from scratch (costly, long) with smaller patch sizes. They achieve good performance on pixel-level tasks like depth estimation and sematic segmentation by training a networks with conv2Dt upsampling on datasets with pixel-level annotations. Unfortunately, we don't have access to pixel level annotation datasets for most materials science or biological image processing problems, and would like to achieve high-resolution features without additional training or datasets.

### Prior Work:
Amir *et. al.* (VE) [[4]](#links) achieved high resolution features from `DINO` [[5]](#links) and other `ViTs` by adjusting the stride of the conv2D in the projection part of the embedding layer. Normally the stride $S$ is equal to the patch size $P$ for non-overlapping patches. By setting $S = P/2, P/4, ...$ and interpolating the positional encoding they can achieve higher resolution features by feeding overlapping patches into the network. This works well but has a downside: more patches means more tokens in the transformer network, which scales with token number $n$ as $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ because of the all-to-all nature of attention. Assuming a square image length $L$, the token number scales $n \propto (L / S)^2$. This gives us a **quartic** scaling for memory footprint and time as $S$ decreases (or $L$ increases), so achieving pixel-level features for regular images can be tough.

They used these features for co-segmentation (segmenting common features of multiple realisations of a class) and point correspondence on CUBS [[6]](#links), PASCALVOC12 [[7]](#links) and other datasets using deliberately simple algorithms like k-means. From testing the framework with Dv2, there is sometimes high resolution/artefacting/noise, and for homogeneous micrographs there's a gradient across the image features. 

### Proposed Method:
I propose a different solution (HR-Dv2):

0) Input image $I$ with dimensions $(h, w)$ 
1) Pixel shift the image by $N < P / 2,\:N \in \mathbb{Z^+}$ pixels in the $N_{d}=4/8$ directions in a Von Neumann/Moore neighbourhood with periodic BCs 
2) Compute the (low-res) features for each shifted image with `DINOv2` with $S=P$
3) Resize each low-res map from $(h / P, w / P)$ to $(h, w)$ 
4) Unshift each image by moving it $N$ pixels in the opposite direction
5) Spatially average across all unshifted images to produce high-res $(h, w)$ feature map

This has the same complexity as `DINOv2` as the stride $S$ is the same, and can be done in one forward pass with batching. The memory footprint is dominated by the cost of full-res feature map. It scales better than VE, but has its own drawbacks - namely it can be over-smooth or have grid artefacting. The interesting thing is that **this approach is compatible with the VE approach** by using a VE enhanced Dv2 alongside the pixel shifts (within memory constraints) - we can achieve some crisp $2$ or $4\times$ upsampling with VE then use HR-Dv2 for further upsampling. Also, we aren't just limited to pixel shifts as transformations in steps 1 and 4, we can use any invertible transformation (rotation, flipping, *etc.*)

### INSTALLATION:
```
git clone https://github.com/tldr-group/HR-Dv2
cd HR-Dv2/
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2
pip install -r dinov2/requirements.txt -r dinov2/requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```

### PATHS:
Two possible 'paths'
1) fuse color matting matrix $\psi = \cos{c_{H}, \sin{c_{H}}, c_{s}, c_{v}, p_{x}, p_{y}}$ with a 5-component PCA of HR-Dv2 features and perform clustering
2) use attention maps to find foreground objects. cluster only foreground features? 

### TODO:
- [x] Rewrite the code to use any transformation (list of partial functions & their inverse) and integrate VE code, storing original Dv2 stride and positional encoding code to re-enable later
- [x] Break up utils into more meaningful files (plotting, converting *etc.*) and add docstrings
- [x] Rewrite in module style, create requirements.txt, install locally, move notebooks to separate folder
- [x] Try using flip transforms to ameliorate VE artefacting
- [x] Comparison of the methods to resizing/convolving - visually and MSE wise
- [x] Integrate into SAMBA/trainable segmentation platform?
- [x] High-res video (maybe try on big PC)
- [x] Add rotation transforms, test in microstructure
- [x] Visualise CLS/Attention maps, also high-res them if cheap. Try use that for fg/bg detection
- [x] Test automated 1st PCA component/fg threshold finding using entropy per unit area
- [x] Evaluation of object localization on VOC07 & 12, compare w/ MOST
- [x] Evaluation of foreground segmentation on [CUBS-200-2011](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/cub_200_2011/), [DUTS](http://saliencydetection.net/duts/)
- [ ] Add option to use q,k or v values from attention of CLS (& compare perf)
- [ ] Update segment to use updated crf
- [ ] Add option to use FeatUp's JBU as feature upscaler
- [ ] Add option to use different ViTs (like DINO or SAM)
- [ ] Add small hyperparam optimization task (mix of foreground seg & localization across various DS)
- [ ] Ablations
- [ ] Evalutation of semantic segmentation on Pascal VOC12, compare w/ 'Deep spectral Methods ...' 
- [ ] Evaluation co-segmentation performance on CUBS, comparison to 'Deep ViT Features as Dense Visual Descriptors'
